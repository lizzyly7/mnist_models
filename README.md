*** MNIST IDENTIFING MODELS 
first drft:
  I use the typical picture clacification dataset for tensorflow practing, while at the first experiment, three levela of neural network id built, and it just take short time, so that the model can be convegence, 
  
  the second try:
    the leNet-5 model is been established in the model ,while the time is far long in this time, and this time the convegence is quite strange for that the first loss is 5 or 6 or 7,but the loss change to 100 or less than 100 in the next time , which take a long time for model to remain a strong state.
